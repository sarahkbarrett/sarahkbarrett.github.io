        The Wall Street Journal www.wsj.com
        
        <h2>Target Audience</h2>
            <p><ol>
            <li>The Wall Street Journal appeals to all or most Americans who want to receive good news. The WSJ is generally unbiased and a good news source for what's happening in the States and the world. I would say the age range for this website would be 18-55. Most of the young generation doesn't read the newspaper and most seniors read a hard copy of the daily paper.</li><br>
            <li>The WSJ website is very neat and easy to navigate. The main bar simply has the Wall Street Journal title with the three-lined drop down menu in the top left corner. There you can find a simple list of news article categories. </li><br>
            <li>The drop down menu has all the categories and articles within those categories are easy to find.</li><br>
            <li>The WSJ website is very user friendly and it is easy to use. Everything is very simple. You can't get lost on this website even if you tried.</li><br>
            <li>The site transformed into a very successful mobile site that is easy for users to navigate.</li>
            </ol></p>
        
        <h2>Persona</h2>
        <p>
        Name: Dave Daveson<br>
        Photo: <img src="https://www.usability.gov/sites/default/files/images/persona.jpg"><br>
        Job Title: Retired CEO of Taco Bell<br>

                            <li>Divorced</li>
                            <li>No children</li>

                            <li>Has Master's in business management</li></ul>  <br>  
        
        Goals and Tasks: He wants to stay informed with US and world politics and happenings. He spends his time doing tai-chi in the park and reading good books. He likes tea and peace and quiet. He also spends time volunteering at the library. <br>
        Environment: He isn't a pro with technolgy, but he can usually manage if a website is simple enough. He checks the newspaper at home when it's quiet.<br>

        <h2>Site Contrast: UPS (www.ups.com)</h2>
        <ul><li>The UPS trackig website seems to know who their audience is, but it's not tailored well to fit their needs. Both websites did a good job at knowing who their audiences are.</li>
        <li>The WSJ did an excellent job of meeting the needs of its audience. It displayed information very neatly and orderly. UPS, however, was very messy and had way too many little details that overcrowded the webpage.</li>
        <li>The WSJ did a good job at organizing its content and displaying it clearly. The UPS website had too much information in small text all over the page. </li>
        <li>The WSJ mobile website definitely did a better job at facillitating visitors on their mobile web page. It is far easier to navigate and read than the UPS website and all over nicer to look at.</li></ul>
