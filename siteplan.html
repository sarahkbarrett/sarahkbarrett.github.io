       <p> Goals: Joe wants to keep up with the weather so he knows what to wear to movie premieres and award shows.

           <br>
        Environment: Joe is very tech savvy. He has a smart house and likes that he can talk to his technology. He spends a lot of time on Twitter and trying to remember his old Myspace password. Using a weather app is very easy for him. <br>

        <h2>Peer Review</h2>
        <h4>Maggie Klinke</h4>
        <p>Maggie suggested that I amp up my audience description since it started off very small. I went onto Ilearn to find the guidelines and added more detail to the section to make it longer and more descriptive, such as what devices the weather will be checked on, when they are checking it, etc.</p>
        <h4>Hailey Beazer</h4>
        <p>After fixing the changes that Maggie suggested, Hailey thought my page looked good and didn't have any additional suggestions for my webpage.</p>
