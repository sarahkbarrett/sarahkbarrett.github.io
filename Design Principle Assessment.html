			<h1>Design Principles in Mobile Sites</h1>
			<!-- ***********************************************
Each design principle needs four items:
1- The principle's name and the team member responsible for it.
2- An image (screenshot) of the mobile browser screen showing the design principle in use.
3- The site name used in the picture
4- A discussion of how the design principle is exemplified in the picture. Be detailed!

			<h2>Proximity &mdash; Hailey Beazer</h2>

				www.vioski.com
			</p>
			<p>
				This webpage uses variety of proximity to organized the website. The use of white space in the website creates a clean look and simplicity. 
			</p>

			<h2>Alignment &mdash; James Worthen</h2>

				www.m.newegg.com
			</p>
			<p>
				Vertical Alignment for header with menu and an equal size footer
it starts off with a central alignment with different products going down the site until the second half of the website switches to a modular design with columns and rows to selectdifferent links in their site
			</p>

			<h2>Repetition &mdash; Joseph Luchs</h2>

				www.google.com
			</p>
			<p>
				Google search demonstrates repetition through a repeated pattern and color scheme.  This pattern being the title in blue, the link in green, and then two lines of text in black, with sublinks underneath that in blue when applicable.  This pattern is repeated (with occasional variation for I mages or other content,) no matter what your search is.  There is also repetition of shape, with each result being contained within a rectangle, though the size may vary, the shape itself is consistent.

			<h2>Contrast &mdash; Sarah Barrett></h2>

				www.wsj.com
			</p>
			<p>
				The Wall Street Journal does an excellent job at creating contrast. Their entire page almost represents a real newspaper. The entire page is white, with bold, black headlines and black paragraph text. The captions are slightly different enough to differentiate from normal text to caption. Then, under all that in bright red is the "more" links to draw your attention to more articles.

			<h2>Typography &mdash; Hailey Beazer</h2>

			<p>
				www.culture.pl
			</p>
			<p>
				This webpage has great contrast just because of the typography. The type has many different sizes and colors that make the words stand out. It makes the webpage much more interesting
