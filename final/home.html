		<h2>What the heck is this?</h2>
		<p>Hello, visitor! This webpage was created by Sarah Barrett, a Sophomore at Brigham Young University -  Idaho for a final project in her Web Frontend Development class. The purpose of this website is to provid excellent style inspiration for the average and not-so average plus size women. You'll find good pictures and you'll be linked to fashion bloggers and stores where you can buy these excellent items. Enjoy!</p>

						<p>That doesn't mean we don't also like rapids. Opposites in all things after all. We believe that that tenseness that comes when you are looking down the tongue of a big string of waves makes you appreciate the calm beautiful water that always follows even more.</p></div>
